## NoteJar 🫙📝

### Description
Note Jar is a note-taking memory app for iOS 17.0+. It's built with Swift and SwiftUI. The backend uses SwiftData (& Predicates) to model and manage the data of the user, which is how all data is stored. NoteJar was created to raise awareness about the (scientific) importance of gratitude. Through behavior nudges, it inspires users to cultivate mindfulness to improve their relationships both with themselves and the people around them. Whether it's reflecting on the highlights of each day throughout 2024, tracking the progress of your new goal, or fostering recognition and appreciation within your team at work, NoteJar offers limitless possibilities for capturing and celebrating life's moments by creating personalized jars.

Features: 
- Daily gratitude tips based on research
- Create jars 
- Add notes to the jars 
- Draw a random note

The Swift Data framework will allow the users to also share Jars and Notes with each
